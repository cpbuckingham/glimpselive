        <p>It's not! It's just working to help people manage their healthiness. It was born from an idea that all people need help maintaining the physical fitness, especially me. So I wanted to create an application that enabled people to do that too.
        </p>

        <p>At the moment it is just <a href="https://cpbuckingham.com"> Cam Buckingham</a>. Cam is determined to build a branding of "Streaker" to light. He believes that in ordre to learn new things he has to dedicate himself to complete 4-5 goals over a year long time, or a 365-day streak. He does his streaking without stopping, without adjustments, and blogs about the whole experience. Check out more on his blog about his experiences. But as more users start to use the site with their friends and we grow, we will be looking for developers to help support the site with a love for fitness and a healthy lifestyle. Stay tuned</p>
        </p>

        <p>We like these hashtags: #noCodeSnobs (because we value community over efficiency), #newKidLove (because we all started somewhere), #unassumeCore because we don't assume knowledge), and #BlackLivesMatter (because of course).
        </p>

        <h4>In practice:</h4>
        <ul class="statement-list bullets">
          <li> We are not code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.  </li>
          <li>We insist on actively engaging with requests for feedback regardless of their complexity. </li>
          <li>We welcome newcomers and prioritize the education of others. We strive to approach all tasks with the enthusiasm of a newcomer. Because we believe that newcomers are just as valuable in this effort as experts. </li>
          <li>We consistently make the effort to actively recognize and validate multiple types of contributions. </li>
          <li>We are always willing to offer help or guidance. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>In times of conflict:</h4>
        <ul class="statement-list bullets">
          <li>We listen.</li>
          <li>We clearly communicate while acknowledging other's feelings.</li>
          <li>We admit when we're wrong, apologize, and accept responsibility for our actions.</li>
          <li>We are continuously seeking to improve ourselves and our community.</li>
          <li>We keep our community respectful and open. </li>
          <li>We make everyone feel heard.</li>
          <li>We are mindful and kind in our interactions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>In the future:</h4>
        <ul class="statement-list bullets">
          <li>The future is now.</li>
        </ul>
